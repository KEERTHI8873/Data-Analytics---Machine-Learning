# Data-Analytics---Machine-Learning
Iris Dataset – Random Forest Classification (Machine Learning Project)
📌 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based classification model built using the Random Forest algorithm to classify the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements — Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
It uses the Iris Dataset (extended version) and implements data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.
The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and standard ML libraries without any Flask or web app integration.

🎯 Objectives
Load and explore the Iris Dataset

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict species

Evaluate the model’s accuracy and classification performance

Save the trained model for reuse

Provide a GitHub-ready repository with clean code and documentation

⚙️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas → Data handling

numpy → Numerical operations

matplotlib, seaborn → Visualization

scikit-learn → Model building & evaluation
